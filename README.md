# Fleshgrinder’s php-fpm-config

This is my personal php-fpm configuration which I keep improving while using it whenever I have the possibility to. I’m using php-fpm mainly to run Drupal/Pressflow sites in conjunction with nginx.

## Purpose

The purpose of the configuration is to have a high performance php implementation, but also a very secure system.
